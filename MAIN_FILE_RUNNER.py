#Purpose of the Program:

''' 
I wanted to create a tool for programmers and anyone who was interested in stocks-
to easily pull data simply by running this script and entering input. 
This program is a great way for people to observe the scheduled- 
Earnings Per Share Reports for a specific date. 
Ultimately this program should be used as a tool to enhance-
the userâ€™s trading strategies when planning on making trades when earnings season is on.
