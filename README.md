#Project EPS Scraper V1.0.0

THEORY: It is believed that analyzing a stock is made easier a couple of days(or weeks) in advance of its EPS(Earnings Per Share) Report. The stock will have multiple expected EPS reports on it by expert analysts, and will also generate a high trading volume the days leading up to the EPS Report release on Brokerage firms.

GOAL: Make better trades on companies that were oblivious to us beforehand. Decide between making Call or Put Options on the Specific company. Be aware that there is an upcoming EPS report scheduled for the company.

TOOLS: Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, HTML,

PROCESS: Yahoo Finance has an Events section for every day on the calendar. The events list out how many EPS Reports are going to be announced that day. Scrape the Ticker Symbols along with the date in which the EPS report is set to announce.
